Slide 2: What is GitHub Copilot?
	•	GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write code faster and smarter.
	•	It uses OpenAI’s models to understand what we’re trying to do and then suggests code, functions, or even entire files.
	•	You can think of it as a pair programmer sitting beside you — helping you write, explain, and improve your code in real time.
	•	It works with almost every major programming language and framework, and integrates smoothly with tools like VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, and Neovim.
	•	In short, Copilot helps us focus more on solving problems and less on typing repetitive code.

Slide 3: Why Copilot?
	•	Copilot helps us focus on innovation rather than repetition.
	•	Developers who use Copilot have reported higher job satisfaction, mainly because it makes coding more fun and less stressful.
	•	Studies show that it can increase productivity by up to 55% — meaning we can build features faster without lowering code quality.
	•	It encourages collaboration and learning, as we can ask Copilot to explain code we don’t understand or quickly generate examples.
	•	Overall, it helps teams move faster, stay consistent, and deliver better software.

Slide 4: Core Capabilities

Let’s look at what Copilot can actually do on a daily basis.
	•	💬 Inline Chat
You can literally chat with Copilot inside your editor — ask it to fix bugs, explain code, or even generate new functions in plain English.
	•	📖 Code Explanation
If you come across someone else’s code and can’t figure it out, Copilot can explain it line by line in simple language.
	•	🧠 Context-Aware Code Suggestions
Copilot doesn’t just suggest random code. It understands the context of your project and your current file to generate accurate, relevant code snippets.
	•	🧩 Prompt to Code Generation
You can write something like “create a REST API controller for users” — and Copilot will generate it for you instantly.
	•	🧪 Test and Documentation Generation
It can write unit tests for your functions and even generate basic documentation or comments automatically.
	•	🔄 Refactoring Support
When your code looks messy, Copilot can help clean it up — suggest better variable names, split long methods, and improve readability.
	•	🐞 Debugging and Security Help
It can point out potential bugs, missing validations, or even risky code that might lead to security issues.
	•	⚙️ Code Review Assistance
Copilot can act like a smart reviewer. It can analyze your pull requests, suggest improvements, and even catch common mistakes before you merge.
	•	🧰 Slash Commands
In the Copilot Chat, you can use commands like /tests, /docs, or /explain to perform quick actions such as generating test cases or adding documentation.
	•	🌐 Multi-Language and Framework Support
Whether you code in Python, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, or even SQL, Copilot understands them all.
	•	💻 Copilot in CLI
You can use Copilot directly in the terminal. For example, ask it “How do I delete all local Git branches except main?” — and it gives you the exact command.
	•	🔍 Learning and Brainstorming Help
Sometimes, you just want to explore an idea or see how something can be done. Copilot can help brainstorm and generate quick prototypes too.

In short, Copilot is not just an autocomplete tool — it’s like having an intelligent co-developer who’s available 24/7.
